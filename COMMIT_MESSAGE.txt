feat(dashboard): Enhance dashboard with new metrics, layouts, and cost analysis charts

## 📊 New Features

### Live Building Data
- Added "Avg Light Level" metric card with real-time light sensor data (lux)
- Integrated LIGHT sensor type into data fetching and aggregation logic

### Historical Data Analysis
- Redesigned layout from 3-column to 2-column grid for better readability
- Charts now display 2 per row:
  * Row 1: Temperature History + Humidity History
  * Row 2: CO₂ History + Sound Level History

### Occupation Rate Analytics (New Section)
- Moved "Global Occupation Statistics" doughnut chart to dedicated section
- Redesigned "Individual Desk Occupancy Status" with side-by-side bar chart
- Color-coded bars: Green (free desks) vs Red (occupied desks)
- Enhanced visual representation for desk usage monitoring

### Cost Analysis Enhancements
- Added "Energy Cost Trend Over Time" area chart
- Added "Cost vs Energy Consumption Analysis" scatter plot
- Improved cost visualization with multiple chart types
- Better insights into energy consumption patterns and costs

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Frontend (dashboard.html)
- Added light level metric card to Live Building Data section
- Changed `.charts-grid--3col` to `.charts-grid--2col` for Historical Data
- Created new "Occupation Rate Analytics" section
- Added canvas elements for new cost analysis charts
- Reorganized chart layout for better UX

### JavaScript (dashboard.js)
- Added LIGHT to sensor types array for data fetching
- Implemented light level average calculation and display
- Created `renderDeskOccupancyBars()` for individual desk visualization
- Added `updateCostAreaChart()` for energy cost trend (area chart)
- Added `updateCostScatterChart()` for cost vs consumption analysis
- Enhanced chart rendering with proper color schemes and tooltips

## 📋 Files Modified

- src/main/resources/templates/dashboard.html
  * Lines 223-235: Added Avg Light Level metric card
  * Lines 339-357: Changed grid layout to 2-column
  * Lines 668-826: Moved occupation stats and added new charts

- src/main/resources/static/javascript/dashboard.js
  * Line 495: Added LIGHT sensor type
  * Lines 586-603: Added light level calculation
  * Lines 1136-1196: Redesigned desk occupancy visualization
  * Lines 941-1131: Added area and scatter chart implementations

## 🎯 User Impact

✅ Better visualization of light levels across the building
✅ Improved readability with 2-column chart layout
✅ Enhanced desk occupancy monitoring with color-coded bars
✅ Richer cost analysis with multiple chart types
✅ More intuitive section organization

## ⚠️ Notes

- Charts will display data once sensor_data table is populated
- Light sensor data requires LIGHT device type sensors in database
- Cost calculations based on energy consumption with configurable rate
- All new charts support real-time refresh with existing auto-refresh mechanism

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

- Data seeding mechanism for testing and demo purposes
- Advanced filtering for cost analysis charts
- Export functionality for cost reports
